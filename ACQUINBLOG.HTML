      <b>My Hero Academia</b> is a Japanese anime and manga series created by Kohei Horikoshi. It tells the inspiring story of Izuku Midoriya, a young boy who dreams of becoming a hero even though he was born without superpowers, known as “Quirks.” In a world where almost everyone has special abilities, Midoriya’s determination to help others makes him truly special.

    <p>
      The story begins with Midoriya’s strong admiration for his idol, All Might, the greatest hero of all time. Even without powers, he keeps studying heroes and taking notes on their fighting styles. One day, his courage catches All Might’s attention, and he is chosen to inherit All Might’s power called “One For All.” From that moment, Midoriya’s journey to become a professional hero begins.
